/**
 * undefined is a global value that represents the absence of an assigned value.
 * Setting a variable to undefined means the variable effectively does not exist. Some processes, such as JSON serialization, may strip 'undefined' properties from objects. 
 * 
 * the type of 'undefined' is undefined
